This Task View contains information about using R to obtain open data. Much open data is available on the web, and the [WebTechnologies](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html) TaskView generally addresses how to obtain and parse web-based data. There is obvious overlap between the two TaskViews, so some packages are described on both. There is also a considerable amount of open data available as R packages on CRAN. We point readers to the <pkg>crandatapkgs</pkg> package to obtain information about currently available open data in R packages.

Another key issue in a data-focused TaskView is the meaning of "open" data. This TaskView covers many types of data that come with varying degrees of usage restrictions from public domain (or CC-0) data that is usable for any purpose to "freely available" data that is available at no cost but may have licenses that are not strictly speaking "open". Users should investigate the terms of use and licensing of any data referenced here before using it for any particular application. Additionally, the view lists wrappers for paid APIs, as well as those that require an account but are not necessarily subscription only. These are marked (\$) and (K) respectively.

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions, revisions, or improvements for this taskview, go to GitHub and [submit an issue](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata/issues), or make some changes and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata/pulls). If you can't contribute on GitHub, [send Jaime an email](mailto:jashander@ucdavis.edu?subject=Open Data Task View). If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that package.

If you know of a web service, API, data source, or other online resource that is not yet supported by an R package, consider adding it to [the package development to do list on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata/wiki/ToDo).
