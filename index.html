<h2 id="tools-for-working-with-the-web-from-r">Tools for Working with the Web from R</h2>
<h3 id="parsing-data-from-the-web">Parsing Data from the Web</h3>
<ul>
<li>txt, csv, etc.: you can use <code>read.csv()</code> after acquiring the csv file from the web via e.g., <code>getURL()</code> from RCurl. <code>read.csv()</code> works with http but not https, i.e.: <code>read.csv(&quot;http://...&quot;)</code>, but not <code>read.csv(&quot;https://...&quot;)</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/repmis/index.html">repmis</a> package contains a <code>source_data()</code> command to load plain-text data from a URL (either http or https).</li>
<li>The package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html">XML</a> contains functions for parsing XML and HTML, and supports xpath for searching XML (think regex for strings). A helpful function to read data from one or more HTML tables is <code>readHTMLTable()</code>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scrapeR/index.html">scrapeR</a> provides additional tools for scraping data from HTML and XML documents.</li>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML2R/index.html">XML2R</a>: The XML2R package is a collection of convenient functions for coercing XML into data frames. The development version is on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cpsievert/XML2R">here</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjson/index.html">rjson</a> converts R object into Javascript object notation (JSON) objects and vice-versa.</li>
<li>An alternative to the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjson/index.html">rjson</a> is <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJSONIO/index.html">RJSONIO</a> which also converts to and from data in JSON format (it is fast for parsing).</li>
<li>An alternative to the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html">XML</a> package is <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/selectr/index.html">selectr</a>, which parses CSS3 Selectors and translates them to XPath 1.0 expressions.</li>
<li>Custom formats: Some web APIs provide custom data formats which are usually modified xml or json, and handled by <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html">XML</a> and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjson/index.html">rjson</a> or <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJSONIO/index.html">RJSONIO</a>, respectively.</li>
<li>An alternative to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html">XML</a> is <a href="http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/">selectr</a>, which parses CSS3 Selectors and translates them to XPath 1.0 expressions. <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html">XML</a> package is often used for parsing xml and html, but <a href="http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/">selectr</a> translates CSS selectors to XPath, so can use the CSS selectors instead of XPath. The <a href="http://selectorgadget.com/">selectorgadget browser extension</a> can be used to identify page elements.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RHTMLForms/">RHTMLForms</a> allows to read HTML documents and obtain a description of each of the forms it contains, along with the different elements and hidden fields</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="curl-http-ftp-html-xml-soap">Curl, HTTP, FTP, HTML, XML, SOAP</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>: A low level curl wrapper that allows one to compose general HTTP requests and provides convenient functions to fetch URIs, get/post forms, etc. and process the results returned by the Web server. This provides a great deal of control over the HTTP/FTP connection and the form of the request while providing a higher-level interface than is available just using R socket connections. It also provide tools for Web authentication.</li>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>: A light wrapper around <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a> that makes many things easier, but still allows you to access the lower level functionality of <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>. It has convenient http verbs: <code>GET()</code>, <code>POST()</code>, <code>PUT()</code>, <code>DELETE()</code>, <code>PATCH()</code>, <code>HEAD()</code>, <code>BROWSE()</code>. These wrap functions are more convenient to use, though less configurable than counterparts in <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>. The equivalent of httr's <code>GET()</code> in <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a> is <code>getForm()</code>. Likewise, the equivalent of <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html">httr</a> 's <code>POST()</code> in <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a> is <code>postForm()</code>. http status codes are helpful for debugging http calls. This package makes this easier using, for example, <code>stop_for_status()</code> gets the http status code from a response object, and stops the function if the call was not successful. See also <code>warn_for_status()</code>. Note that you can pass in additional Curl options to the <code>config</code> parameter in http calls.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/XMLRPC/">XMLRPC</a> package provides an implementation of XML-RPC, a relatively simple remote procedure call mechanism that uses HTTP and XML. This can be used for communicating between processes on a single machine or for accessing Web services from within R.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/XMLSchema/">XMLSchema</a> package provides facilities in R for reading XML schema documents and processing them to create definitions for R classes and functions for converting XML nodes to instances of those classes. It provides the framework for meta-computing with XML schema in R</li>
<li><a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RTidyHTML/">RTidyHTML</a> interfaces to the libtidy library for correcting HTML documents that are not well-formed. This library corrects common errors in HTML documents.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.omegahat.org/SSOAP/">SSOAP</a> provides a client-side SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) mechanism. It aims to provide a high-level interface to invoke SOAP methods provided by a SOAP server.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.omegahat.org/Rcompression/">Rcompression</a>: Interface to zlib and bzip2 libraries for performing in-memory compression and decompression in R. This is useful when receiving or sending contents to remote servers, e.g. Web services, HTTP requests via RCurl.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/CGIwithR/">CGIwithR</a> package allows one to use R scripts as CGI programs for generating dynamic Web content. HTML forms and other mechanisms to submit dynamic requests can be used to provide input to R scripts via the Web to create content that is determined within that R script.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using web resources can require authentication, either via API keys, OAuth, username:password combination, or via other means. Additionally, sometimes web resources that require authentication be in the header of an http call, which requires a little bit of extra work. API keys and username:password combos can be combined within a url for a call to a web resource (api key: http://api.foo.org/?key=yourkey; user/pass: http://username:password@api.foo.org), or can be specified via commands in <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a> or <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>. OAuth is the most complicated authentication process, and can be most easily done using <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>. See the 6 demos within <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>, three for OAuth 1.0 (linkedin, twitter, vimeo) and three for OAuth 2.0 (facebook, github, google). <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ROAuth/index.html">ROAuth</a> is a package that provides a separate R interface to OAuth. OAuth is easier to to do in <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>, so start there.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="web-frameworks">Web Frameworks</h3>
<ul>
