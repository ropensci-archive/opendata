      This task view contains information about using R to obtain and parse data from the web. The base version of R does not ship with many tools for interacting with the web. Thankfully, there are an increasingly large number of tools for interacting with the web. A list of available packages and functions is presented below, grouped by the type of activity.

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this taskview, go to GitHub and
      <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/webservices/issues">
        submit an issue
      </a>, or make some changes and

        send Scott an email
      </a>. If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that package.

If you know of a web service, API, data source, or other online resource that is not yet supported by an R package, consider adding it to [the package development to do list on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices/wiki/ToDo).

          <em>
            downloading files
          </em>:
<tt>download.file()</tt>
          is in base R and commonly used way to download a file. However, downloading files over HTTPS is not supported in R's internal method for
<tt>download.file()</tt>. The
<tt>download()</tt>
          function in the package
<a href="../packages/downloader/index.html">downloader</a>
          wraps
<tt>download.file()</tt>, and takes all the same arguments, but works for https across platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            tabular data as txt, csv, etc.
          </em>: You can use
<tt>read.table()</tt>,
<tt>read.csv()</tt>, and friends to read a table directly from a URL, or after acquiring the csv file from the web via e.g.,
<tt>getURL()</tt>
          from RCurl.
<tt>read.csv()</tt>
          works with http but not https, i.e.:
<tt>read.csv(&quot;http://...&quot;)</tt>, but not
<tt>read.csv(&quot;https://...&quot;)</tt>. You can download a file first before reading the file in R, and you can use
<a href="../packages/downloader/index.html">downloader</a>
          to download over https.
<tt>read.table()</tt>
          and friends also have a
<tt>text</tt>
          parameter so you can read a table if a table is encoded as a string with line breaks, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            JSON I/O
          </em>: JSON is
          <em>
            javascript object notation
          </em>. There are three packages for reading and writing JSON:
<a href="../packages/rjson/index.html">rjson</a>,
<a href="../packages/RJSONIO/index.html">RJSONIO</a>, and
<a href="../packages/jsonlite/index.html">jsonlite</a>.
<a href="../packages/jsonlite/index.html">jsonlite</a>
          includes a different parser from
<a href="../packages/RJSONIO/index.html">RJSONIO</a>

          <a href="https://lloyd.github.io/yajl/">

          <em>
            XML/HTML I/O
          </em>: The package
<a href="../packages/XML/index.html">XML</a>
          contains functions for parsing XML and HTML, and supports xpath for searching XML (think regex for strings). A helpful function to read data from one or more HTML tables is
<tt>readHTMLTable()</tt>.
<a href="../packages/XML/index.html">XML</a>
          also includes
          <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/">

          parsing ability, see
<tt>xpathApply()</tt>
          and
<tt>xpathSApply()</tt>. The
<a href="../packages/XML2R/index.html">XML2R</a>
          package is a collection of convenient functions for coercing XML into data frames (development version
          <a href="https://github.com/cpsievert/XML2R">
            on GitHub
          </a>). An alternative to

          is
          <a href="http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/">
            selectr
          </a>, which parses CSS3 Selectors and translates them to XPath 1.0 expressions.
<a href="../packages/XML/index.html">XML</a>
          package is often used for parsing xml and html, but
          <a href="http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/">
            selectr
          </a>
          translates CSS selectors to XPath, so can use the CSS selectors instead of XPath. The

      <ul>
        <li>
<a href="../packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>: A low level curl wrapper that allows one to compose general HTTP requests and provides convenient functions to fetch URIs, get/post forms, etc. and process the results returned by the Web server. This provides a great deal of control over the HTTP/FTP connection and the form of the request while providing a higher-level interface than is available just using R socket connections. It also provide tools for Web authentication.
        </li>
        <li>
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>: A light wrapper around
<a href="../packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>
          that makes many things easier, but still allows you to access the lower level functionality of
<a href="../packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>. It has convenient http verbs:
<tt>GET()</tt>,
<tt>POST()</tt>,
<tt>PUT()</tt>,
<tt>DELETE()</tt>,
<tt>PATCH()</tt>,
<tt>HEAD()</tt>,
<tt>BROWSE()</tt>. These wrap functions are more convenient to use, though less configurable than counterparts in
<a href="../packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>. The equivalent of httr's
<tt>GET()</tt>
          in
<a href="../packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>
          is
<tt>getForm()</tt>. Likewise, the equivalent of
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>

<tt>POST()</tt>
          in
<a href="../packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>
          is
<tt>postForm()</tt>. http status codes are helpful for debugging http calls. This package makes this easier using, for example,
<tt>stop_for_status()</tt>
          gets the http status code from a response object, and stops the function if the call was not successful.  See also
<tt>warn_for_status()</tt>. Note that you can pass in additional Curl options to the
<tt>config</tt>
          parameter in http calls.
        </li>
        <li>
<a href="../packages/curl/index.html">curl</a>: The
<tt>curl</tt>
          package has a function
<tt>curl()</tt>
          that's a drop-in replacement for base
<tt>url()</tt>
          with better performance and support for http 2.0, ssl (https, ftps), gzip, deflate and more. There's also a replacement for

          package provides an implementation of XML-RPC, a relatively simple remote procedure call mechanism that uses HTTP and XML. This can be used for communicating between processes on a single machine or for accessing Web services from within R.

<a href="http://www.Omegahat.org/SSOAP/"><span class="Ohat">SSOAP</span></a>
          provides a client-side SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) mechanism. It aims to provide a high-level interface to invoke SOAP methods provided by a SOAP server.

<a href="http://www.Omegahat.org/Rcompression/"><span class="Ohat">Rcompression</span></a>: Interface to zlib and bzip2 libraries for performing in-memory compression and decompression in R.

          The
<a href="http://www.Omegahat.org/CGIwithR/"><span class="Ohat">CGIwithR</span></a>
          package allows one to use R scripts as CGI programs for generating dynamic Web content. HTML forms and other mechanisms to submit dynamic requests can be used to provide input to R scripts via the Web to create content that is determined within that R script. (not on CRAN)

        </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Using web resources can require authentication, either via API keys, OAuth, username:password combination, or via other means. Additionally, sometimes web resources that require authentication be in the header of an http call, which requires a little bit of extra work.  API keys and username:password combos can be combined within a url for a call to a web resource (api key: http://api.foo.org/?key=yourkey; user/pass: http://username:password@api.foo.org), or can be specified via commands in
<a href="../packages/RCurl/index.html">RCurl</a>
          or
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>. OAuth is the most complicated authentication process, and can be most easily done using
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>. See the 6 demos within
<a href="../packages/httr/index.html">httr</a>, three for OAuth 1.0 (linkedin, twitter, vimeo) and three for OAuth 2.0 (facebook, GitHub, google).
<a href="../packages/ROAuth/index.html">ROAuth</a>
          is a package that provides a separate R interface to OAuth. OAuth is easier to to do in
